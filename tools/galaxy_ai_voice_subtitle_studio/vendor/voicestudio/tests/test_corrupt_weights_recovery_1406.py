"""A weight file that is present but unparseable is repairable (#1406).

Two failure shapes come out of an interrupted or mangled model download, and
only one of them was handled:

* the shard is **missing** — transformers says "does not appear to have a file
  named …", and a whole recovery ladder repairs it; and
* the shard is **present with wrong bytes** — a download that stopped
  mid-file, an antivirus that truncated it, a proxy that saved an HTML error
  page under its name. transformers opens it happily and safetensors then
  fails parsing its header-length prefix.

The second reached the user as a raw 500 — "Error while deserializing header:
header too large" — on every generation, from voice design and gallery
previews alike, with no repair attempted. It could not reach the ladder for
two independent reasons: the wording is not the missing-shard wording, and
``SafetensorError`` is a Rust-extension exception, not an ``OSError``.

It also needs the *opposite* repair. The ladder resumes a download, and a
resume trusts a blob that is already the expected size — so it would never
re-fetch the one file that is actually wrong.
