"""Three digits in a path are not an authentication failure.

`classify()` matched a bare ``"401"`` substring, and used it to satisfy *both*
halves of the HF-auth condition — so any message containing those digits
anywhere classified as ``HF_AUTH_FAILED`` on its own. Paths, byte counts, job
ids and durations all qualify.

It surfaced in CI when pytest's numbered temp directory reached
``pytest-401``: an audio-save failure came back telling the user to set a
valid ``HF_TOKEN``. That is worse than an unclassified error — it is a
confident wrong instruction, attached to a docs deeplink, in an auto-filed bug
report. And because it depends on a counter that changes between runs, it is
the kind of bug that passes locally forever.

Two independent guards now: the digits must be a standalone token, and they
are no longer sufficient evidence by themselves.
